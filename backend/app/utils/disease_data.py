        "crop": "Apple",
        "disease": "Apple Scab",
        "cause": "Apple scab overwinters primarily in fallen leaves and in the soil. Disease development is favored by wet, cool weather that generally occurs in spring and early summer. Fungal spores are carried by wind, rain or splashing water from the ground to flowers, leaves or fruit. During damp or rainy periods, newly opening apple leaves are extremely susceptible to infection. The longer the leaves remain wet, the more severe the infection will be. Apple scab spreads rapidly between 55-75 degrees Fahrenheit.",
        "prevention": [
            "Choose resistant varieties when possible.",
            "Rake under trees and destroy infected leaves to reduce the number of fungal spores available to start the disease cycle over again next spring.",
            "Water in the evening or early morning hours (avoid overhead irrigation) to give the leaves time to dry out before infection can occur.",

In wet weather, spores are released from these infections and spread by wind or splashing water. The fungus infects leaves and fruit through natural openings or minor wounds.",
        "prevention": [
            "Prune out dead or diseased branches.",
            "Remove infected plant material from the area.",

It spends a portion of its two-year life cycle on Eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana). The pathogen's spores develop in late fall on the juniper as a reddish brown gall on young branches of the trees.",
        "prevention": [
            "Since the juniper galls are the source of the spores that infect the apple trees, cutting them is a sound strategy if there aren't too many of them.",
            "While the spores can travel for miles, most of the ones that could infect your tree are within a few hundred feet.",
